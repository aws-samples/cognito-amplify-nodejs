# Integrate Amazon Cognito to a React app
This is a very simple NodeJS + React app to demonstrate how to integrate Amazon Cognito as an identity provider.

To run this demo you need to have Node.JS version 16 or above installed on you computer.
Download the source code and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Those commands will download the dependencies and start the application locally.
By default it runs on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)

Follow the blogpost instructions to understand how it works and how to configure the dependencies.
